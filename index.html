<h2>Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
<p>
  I don't remember the first time I ever used a computer; it must have been some time early in elementary school, since I distinctly remember using the internet frequently by third or fourth grade. It was on an old desktop running Windows XP - since then I've owned a macbook as well as a linux machine, though I'm currently on Windows. Since I've grown up using the internet, most of my day is spent reading, watching videos, playing games, and chatting with friends on my computer, and I don't particularly see this changing in the near future (with the exception of how I might use a computer for my job). I assume most people in computer science lead a similar lifestyle, plus programming and software development and all of the activities that that entails. Personally, I'm studying computer science because I took COMPSCI 101 in my first year and found it fun and interesting. During my years in college, I've taken computer science classes in various subfields, and now I am taking this web development class since it is something new for me and it seems interesting. Since web sites are for the most part meant to be used by anyone, I think that any web developer needs a good understanding of UX and front end design. In addition, web sites are different from your basic desktop application in that they require internet connection, so it would be useful to know the basics of how those connections work and related problems such as ones of security/privacy.
