what makes your application useful  
- it's got a kickass orbit diagram view (which hopefully makes up for the somewhat lackluster list below it)
- it's a visualization of an interesting dataset: Near Earth Objects (NEOs) / asteroids

special instructions needed to set up, run, access, or use your application (like user passwords you have set up, command line utilities, or external programs that need to be run)  
- i've set it up already - the admin account is created in seed.rb, and the database is populated through the link on the admin page
- admin account: email "admin@admin", password "password"  
- json data can be accessed here: 
    - https://frozen-lowlands-71905.herokuapp.com/planets.json  
    - https://frozen-lowlands-71905.herokuapp.com/data.json  
- on the main page, you can click the list elements to expand them  
- you can click the names of NEOs in the visualization to see more info  
- control the visualization with the controls at the top right  

references for your data that establishes its authenticity
- my data comes from here:  https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#neows-feed
